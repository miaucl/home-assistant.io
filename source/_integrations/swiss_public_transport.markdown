The Swiss public transport integration will give you the next three departure times from a given location to another one in Switzerland.

The [Swiss public transport API](https://transport.opendata.ch/) only allows 1000 requests per 24 hours. The default polling rate is set to `90s`, which is just enough for one connection polling continuously. If more entries are needed, consider [defining a custom polling interval](#defining-a-custom-polling-interval) to reduce the amount of requests.

{% configuration_basic %}
Start station:
    description: "The departure station for the start of the connection (e.g., 'ZÃ¼rich HB')"
End station:
    description: "The arrival station for the end of the connection (e.g., 'Geneva')"
Via stations:
    description: "List of up to 5 via stations (e.g., 'Bern, Lausanne')"
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

Use the [Stationboard](https://transport.opendata.ch/examples/stationboard.html) to find exact station names.

The public timetables are coming from [Swiss public transport](https://transport.opendata.ch/).
